        <h1>Recognizing Scams</h1>
        <p>As scams evolve in response to awarness, it becomes increasingly difficult to recognize when one is happening. So how can we recognize and protect ourselves, and others, aginst them?</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Only trust legitimate services</h2>
        <p>If you recieve a call or message informing you of a fraudulant purchase, check your bank account before doing anything else. No bank would need access to your computer to help you see your statments.</p>
        <p>Microsoft does not know when your computer is infected, and Windows Defender can't see your browser. Microsoft will never call you because of security threats, and windows defender appears as a notification from your taskbar and doesn't display any contact information.</p>
        <p>Never click on sponsored ad links, or links sent in emails and texts. Even if an email is legitimate, always copy and paste the link into a browser. This can protect you from invisible links that hide malware.</p>
        <p>The IRS sends physical letters in the mail.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Never engage in something that sounds illegal</h2>
        <p>Do not agree to send checks on somone else's behalf.</p>
        <p>Do not use gift cards to pay for services outside of the vendor that issued them.</p>
        <p>You don't need to give bail money to people you just met.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Trust your instincts and listen to warnings</h2>
        <p>If you're not sure, respectfully hang up and call the real number of whoever is contacting you.</p>
        <p>If you're talking to a human, they don't need your codes, whether they be passwords, gift cards or two-factor keys.</p>
        <p>If a business doesn't offer a tangible service or product, or relies on its customers to sell it for them, it's probably a marketing scam.</p>
        <p>There is no good reason why someone would not allow you to talk to other people. If something doesn't seem right, hang up.</p>
        <p>No billing agency, refund department, or government entity will ever make threats of any kind over a processing mistakes. It is NEVER your fault if a payment was accidently filed wrong.</p>

        <h1>Kinds of Scams</h1>
        <p>Scams take many forms, but will almost always devolve into a few different categories. It is important to always be up to date on the newest scams, as they are constantly evolving to be more deceptive. Below is a list of the most common types of scams.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Refund Scams</h2>
        <p>Refund scams typically begin with a message or email informing the victim of confirmation of a fraudulant purchase. After attempting to reverse the charge, by clicking a provided link, the victim is instructed to fill out a refund form that will change the ammount owed as it is entered. The scammer then requires the victim to return the extra money through some other means.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Support Scams</h2>
        <p>Support scams begin with a call or browser popup informing the victim of a potential malware threat on their computer. This can happen when a victim mistypes a URL and is taken to a fake site instead. After convining the victim and gaining access to their computer, the scammer will pretend to run an anti-virus program and then charge the victim for this service.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Blank Check Scams</h2>
        <p>Blank Check scams involve a scammer paying for a service offered by the victim, or by using the vicitm as a means of depositing a check. The scammer will pay using a fake check, which the bank will take serveral days to validate. By the time they inform you that the check bounced, the scammer has already made off with their money or whatever service was offered by the victim.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Pyramid Schemes</h2>
        <p>Pyramid schemes are a business model where the value of the company is soley tied to its investors. A modern take on this is in cryto-scams. The owners use the money made from investments to pay off previouse groups of investors. But becasue the company does not earn money through any other means, this system relies on continuously recruiting new memebers, which inevitably isn't sustainable. When it finally crashes, the owners walk away with millions and the newest groups walk away with debt.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Product Scams</h2>
        <p>Product scams, while tending to operate similarly to pyramid schemes, do offer a real product or service. However, it is the product itself that is the scam. Also referred to as multi-level marketing scams, the business typically promotes a nonsense product or service, while also building a cult following of customers that will help promote the business. These scams typically sell bogus products, such as alternative medicines and psychic services. Mega churches can also fit into this category.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Inheritance Scams</h2>
        <p>Inheritance scams are a broad category of scams where the victim is convinced they are the recipiant of some large Inheritance, either from a lottery, or deceased relative. Other times it claims you've won some free product. And all that is required of the victim, is that they pay a never ending number of processing and shipping fees. These scams take advantage of the Sunk Cost fallacy, or the conviction that one is close to their goal, and so shouldn't bail, even after they've invested more than the expected return.</p>

        <h1>How can I Help?</h1>
        <h2>Share your story</h2>
        <p>If you or somone you know was a victim of a scam, share that story with others, especially when you come across scams. People have the tendancy to shame victims for falling into scams, but if they were made aware of how destructive scams are, and the lengths scammers will go, they may turn that shaming and anger to them instead.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Help people you know</h2>
        <p>Teach those around you. Share this site and other resources with friends and family. If you encounter people being scammed, intervene to to the best of your ability.</p>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Report scam websites and numbers</h2>
        <p>when you visit a site that gets blocked by google, or recieve a text/email that goes to spam, it is because they were reported by other users. You can help prevent people from getting involved in scams by reporting them. Sites can be reported to Google and which ever hosting service is providing the site. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Talk about internet safety</h2>
        <p>Most people are not able to take steps to protect themselves because they don't know where to learn. We have this idea that computer safety is a tech subject and only ever talk about it in the context of technology. You don't need to be a tech influencer to talk about internet safety, everybody can talk about and bring awarness to it.</p>
