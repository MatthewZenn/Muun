        <h1>Kinds of Scams</h1>
        <p>Scams take many forms, but will almost always devolve into a few different categories. It is important to always be up to date on the newest scams, as they are constantly evolving to be more deceptive. Below is a list of the most common types of scams.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Refund Scams</h2>
        <p>Refund scams typically begin with a message or email informing the victim of confirmation of a fraudulant purchase. After attempting to reverse the charge, by clicking a provided link, the victim is instructed to fill out a refund form that will change the ammount owed as it is entered. The scammer then requires the victim to return the extra money through some other means.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Support Scams</h2>
        <p>Support scams begin with a call or browser popup informing the victim of a potential malware threat on their computer. This can happen when a victim mistypes a URL and is taken to a fake site instead. After convining the victim and gaining access to their computer, the scammer will pretend to run an anti-virus program and then charge the victim for this service.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Blank Check Scams</h2>
        <p>Blank Check scams involve a scammer paying for a service offered by the victim, or by using the vicitm as a means of depositing a check. The scammer will pay using a fake check, which the bank will take serveral days to validate. By the time they inform you that the check bounced, the scammer has already made off with their money or whatever service was offered by the victim.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Pyramid Schemes</h2>
        <p>Pyramid schemes are a business model where the value of the company is soley tied to its investors. A modern take on this is in cryto-scams. The owners use the money made from investments to pay off previouse groups of investors. But becasue the company does not earn money through any other means, this system relies on continuously recruiting new memebers, which inevitably isn't sustainable. When it finally crashes, the owners walk away with millions and the newest groups walk away with debt.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Product Scams</h2>
        <p>Product scams, while tending to operate similarly to pyramid schemes, do offer a real product or service. However, it is the product itself that is the scam. Also referred to as multi-level marketing scams, the business typically promotes a nonsense product or service, while also building a cult following of customers that will help promote the business. These scams typically sell bogus products, such as alternative medicines and psychic services.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Inheritance Scams</h2>
        <p>Inheritance scams are a broad category of scams where the victim is convinced they are the recipiant of some large Inheritance, either from a lottery, or deceased relative. Other times it claims you've won some free product. And all that is required of the victim, is that they pay a never ending number of processing and shipping fees. These scams take advantage of the Sunk Cost fallacy, or the conviction that one is close to their goal, and so shouldn't bail, even after they've invested more than the expected return.</p>

        <h1>How can I Help?</h1>
        <h2>Share your story</h2>
        <p>If you or somone you know was a victim of a scam, share that story with others, especially when you come across scams. People have the tendancy to shame victims for falling into scams, but if they were made aware of how destructive scams are, and the lengths scammers will go, they may turn that shaming and anger to them instead.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Help people you know</h2>
        <p>Teach those around you. Share this site and other sources with friends and family. If you encounter people being scammed, intervene to to the best of your ability.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Talk about internet safety</h2>
        <p>Most people are not able to take steps to protect themselves because they don't know where to learn. We have this idea that computer safety is a tech subject and only ever talk about it in the context of technology. You don't need to be a tech influencer to talk about internet safety, everybody can talk about and bring awarness to it.</p>
